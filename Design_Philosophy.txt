Gonna SNAFU this project before it is even born. 
Truffle already has a testing framework so, you know, D.R.Y.

The design philosophy behind Solidest is embodied in the name itself. 

Since these Dapps, these contracts, are not only financialy contingent
but down right mission critical it is necessary that they be built on
the solidest groundwork.

Test Driven Development is no 100% guarantee of flawless software but it 
currently offers one of the best methods of catching mistakes early while 
rapidly leveraging iteratively developed functionality from libraries, standard
algorithms and the individual software developer's suite of skills.

Current fields under consideration in the development of Solidest are the use of a domain specific language to facilitate behaviour driven design, IDE plugins (and which IDEs to plugin to), forking Jest to exploit the javascript-like aspects of Solidity or the necessity to develop Solidest from the ground up.
