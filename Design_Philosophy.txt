The design philosophy behind Solidest is embodied in the name itself. 

Since these Dapps, these contracts, are not only financialy contingent
but down right mission critical it is necessary that they be built on
the solidest groundwork.

Test Driven Development is no 100% guarantee of flawless software but it 
currently offers one of the best methods of catching mistakes early while 
rapidly leveraging iteratively developing functionality from libraries, standard
algorithms and the individual software developer's suite of skills.
